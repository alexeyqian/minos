; kernel is first read to at address:0x8000 from disk by loader in real mode 
; then it's been moved to address:0x30000 from 0x8000 to execute in protection mode.
; the reason for read first then move, is because is easy to read from disk in real mode which has BIOS.
; but the kernel is elf format, and cannot run directly as pure bin, since it has format data.
; so it need to parse the elf file and load/move 'segments' into memory, so it can execute. 
; in protected mode, read from disk is hard, but read from memory is easy.
; so read the file data from disk to memory as buffer for disk data, then parse the data in memory and prepare for execution.

; esp, and GDT will also be moved from loader to kernel for easy control
